<p>I recently graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Washington.  I'm a proud first-generation college graduate.  Having been born to two hardworking Chinese immigrant parents, I've always been raised to value the importance of learning.  I am a life-long learner.  Needless to say, I plan to bring my joy for learning to my professional work.</p>

<p>I am currently seeking a full-time entry-level technical position with no role restrictions.  As I continued learning more about computer science and engineering, I have found that I enjoy how important every role is.  I am quite well-rounded in all, but a master of none.  This is because I enjoy playing with new technologies.  I am a flexible and quick learner.  This being said, my strengths are in frontend development.  I have, however, worked the full-stack of software development: from setting up servers to deploying applications (web/mobile), and even leading as a project manager.</p>

<p class="mb-5">In this portfolio, you will find posts about my academic experiences and opportunities.  I hope to give some insight to myself whilst highlighting my work in a fun, witty, and fresh manner through these posts.  For my resume, other details, or questions, please feel free to reach out to me in the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> section or the methods at the bottom of this page.  I'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>

<p>As an ending note, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in shaping who I am today.  The "me" you're hearing a lot about has much to be grateful for.  My high school computer science teacher, Earl Bergquist, encouraged me to code.  <em>Girls Who Code</em> brought me opportunities to learn in the industry.  <em>College Access Now</em> and <em>College Success Foundation</em> mentors: Chloe, Josh, and Ms.Michelle, who made sure I was prepared on all things college-related.  My high school, university, and <em>Washington State Opportunity Scholarship</em> for funding in more ways than one.  <em>Women in Science and Engineering</em> (<a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/studentprogs/wise/BRIDGE">WiSE Bridge</a>) and the <em>Washington State Academic Redshirt</em> (<a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars">STARS</a>) program for preparing me to be this world-class engineer.  My family, friends, students, teachers, and peers have taught me so much.  Wherever I go, I'll believe in myself and what I have learned from everyone.  As I progress in my technical career, I will support and reach out to communities the same way I have received.  I'll be older, wiser, richer, and a better engineer by then too.  Thank you.  :)</p>
